        <p>3.2.2 If it is a newly added website, you will be prompted to enter the website information </br></p>
        <ol>
        <li>Website name: you cannot use the domain or URL as the website name. If the host is not a national-level website, it cannot use “China” in the name.</br></li>
        <li>Webpage URL: Fill in the top level domain corresponding to the web address (for example www.abc.com). Based on current administrative regulations, register the main top level domain, and if the top level domain is an already filed second level domain, it can usually be used.</br></li>
        <li>If the person responsible for the website and the person responsible for the host are not the same person, fill in separate mobile numbers and email addresses to distinguish them, but the two cannot be the same.</br></li>
        <li>When a website is newly added, we suggest that the host information be examined first. If the host information and actual conditions are not the same, the host information should be amended and the filing should be changed. After the filing has been administratively approved, re-add the website (note: when amending main information, you can’t carry out new-add operations).</li>
        <li>From January 1, 2018, domain names engaged in the use of Internet information should be registered to comply with laws and regulations. The domain name registrant for an individual registration should be the individual themselves. The domain name registrant for an organization registration should be the organization (including company shareholders), the main person in charge of the organization, or senior management personnel. Domain names must also be top-level domain names that have been approved by the state, that have been registered through a state-approved domain name registration service.</li>
