                                    <p>Incoming events refer to data units equal to or less than 64 KB. Every incoming event is a billable event. Bigger messages are charged by multiples of 64 KB. For instance, an 8 KB message is charged as one event, and a 96 KB message is charged as two events.</p>

                                    <p>The throughput unit is selected specifically by the customer through Azure Portal or the Event Hubs’ Management API. The throughput unit will be applied to all Event Hubs in a certain Service Bus namespace, and every throughput unit will assign this namespace the following functions:</p>

                                        <li>1. A max of 1 MB incoming events per second (equal to the number of events sent to Events Hubs), but the incoming events, managed and operated events or controlled API requests per second shall not exceed 1000.</li>
                                        <li>2. A max of 2 MB outgoing events per second (equal to the number of events used by Event Hubs).</li>
                                        <li>3. A max of 84 GB events of storage (enough for the default 24 hour retention period).</li>

                                <section>
                                    <p>If the total incoming throughput or total incoming events rate within all Event Hubs in a namespace exceed the quota of aggregated throughput units, the sender will be restricted, and an error message will pop up indicating an excess beyond the incoming quota.</p>
                                    <p>If the total outgoing throughput or total outgoing events rate within all Event Hubs in a namespace exceed the quota of aggregated throughput units, the receiver will be restricted, and an error message will pop up indicating an excess beyond the outgoing quota. The incoming quota and outgoing quota are implemented separately, thus any sender will not induce the use of slow-down events, and no receiver can stop sending events to the Event Hubs.</p>
                                    <p>Please note, the selection of throughput units has nothing to do with the quantity of Event Hubs partitions (sometimes called segments in similar systems). Notwithstanding, the maximum throughput provided in every partition is 1 MB/1000 incoming events and 2 MB of outgoing events every second, but the partition itself doesn’t generate fixed fees. The fees are collected for the aggregated throughput unit on all Event Hubs in a certain Service Bus namespace. In this way, customers can create enough partitions to support the maximum expected load of the system; but paying a throughput unit fee before the events load on the system really needs bigger throughput is not required, and modifying the system’s structure and architecture to meet the demand for a rising system load is also not required.</p>
                                    <p>Assume that you have selected 8 throughput units in the namespace, and created an individual Event Hub containing 32 partitions. If all partition loads in the Event Hub are balanced, every partition will gain about 0.25 MB/second incoming throughput, and the total aggregated throughput is 8 MB/second. If a 1 MB/second usage peak occurs at a certain partition, and the loads of the other 8 partitions are only half of the peak load (0.125 MB/second), partition constraint will not happen. Yet, if the load peak of a certain partition exceeds 1 MB/second, the partition will be limited (since every partition has a quota), although the aggregated throughput of all partitions is still less than 8 MB/second.</p>

                                    <p>Yes. The basic and standard namespaces may have 20 throughput units at most. You can request more throughput units for the Standard level by filling in support vouchers. Please note, we don’t guarantee that extra capacity over 20 throughput units for every Azure subscription is immediately available. It’s recommended that customers expecting to exceed 20 Event Hubs throughput units contact us as soon as possible within the planning cycle, so as to discuss relevant requirements. Extra throughput units will be provided in the form of 20 unit blocks based on the promised purchase.</p>

At the end of a day, the peak memory size will be computed. The daily storage quota is computed by the minimum throughput units selected in a day (the quota provided by every throughput unit is 84 GB). If the total size exceeds the daily storage quota, the extra storage will be charged at the Azure Blob storage rate (at the local redundant storage rate).</p>

                                <section>

                                            No matter how many transmitting systems/devices there are, transmitting events via HTTP isn’t charged with connection fees. We will count the AMQP connections. But, for every Basic Event Hubs namespace, the first 100 concurrent connections are free of charge; for Standard Event Hubs, the first 1000 concurrent connections for every subscription are free of charge. These limits cover many acceptance programs and service-to-service schemes. Generally, there will be considerable transfer connection fees only when you plan to use AMQP on numerous clients, namely, to realize more efficient event flow or activate two-way communication (IoT command and control programs). For details about the composition of transfer connections and the counting method, please see the information on <a id="pricing_event_hubs_con" href="/home/features/service-bus/#price" style="color: #00a8d9;">Service Bus Connections</a>.

                                   <p>
                                            When capture is activated in the Event Hub in the namespace, the capture function of the Event Hub can be started. This will be charged by the hour according to the throughput units purchased. In the case of an increase or reduction of the throughput units, the variation will be reflected in the billing by hourly increments.

                                            Event Hub Capture will not affect the outgoing rate of the Event Hubs throughput units. You can still read it by the full throughput unit of 2,000 events per second/2MBps for every throughput unit.

                                            Event Hub Capture uses the storage account by the plan you provide. Since this is your storage account, the usage fee of this storage account will be included in your Azure subscription. The shorter the capture window, the more frequent the storage transactions.
