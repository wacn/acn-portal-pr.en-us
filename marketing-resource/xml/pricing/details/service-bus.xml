                                <section>
                                    <p>For the transfer entity (queue, theme/subscription, message buffer zone), one operation refers to any API call to Service Bus services.</p>
                                        <p>Sending, receiving or deleting messages less than or equal to 64 KB is considered a chargeable operation. If the message size exceeds 64 KB, the chargeable operand can be calculated as a multiple of 64 KB. For instance, a one 8KB message sent to the Service Bus is charged as one operation, and one 96KB message sent to the Service Bus is charged as two operations. Reading an 8KB message by locking, then deleting the message will be charged as two operations.</p>
                                        <p>The same message sent several times (e.g.: message is sent to several listeners, or withdrawn after cancellation, delay or mailing failure) will be taken as individual operations. For instance, if a theme has 3 subscriptions, a 64KB message sent and then received will be charged as 4 chargeable operations (1 “incoming” and 3 “outgoing” operations, assuming all messages are sent to all subscriptions and deleted after reading).</p>
                                        <p>You can receive messages by using PeekLock’s ReceiveMode, then deleting the message through a complete call, which will generate two individual operations. Relocking the message will also generate one operation.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, creating, reading (listing), updating and deleting queues, themes or subscriptions will also generate operation expenses.</p>
                                        <p>Operation means API calls to the terminals of queues or themes/subscription services, including management, sending/receiving and session status operations.</p>

                                    <p>The relay hours are charged by the cumulative time when every Service Bus Relay is in an “open” state. When the WCF service (i.e. “Relay Listener”) of an activated relay is connected to the given Service Bus address (service namespace URL) for the first time, the relay will permit implicit instantiation and is opened in the address. The relay will be closed only when the last listener is disconnected from the address. Thus, for the purpose of billing, the relay will be regarded as being in “open” state from the time the first relay listener is connected to the relay’s Service Bus Address to the time when the last relay listener is disconnected from the address.</p>

                                <section>
                                    <p>Transfer connection is defined as one of the following connections:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>An AMQP connection from the client to Service Bus themes/subscriptions, queues or Event Hubs.</li>
                                        <li>An HTTP call to receiving messages from Service Bus themes or queues with a receiving timeout bigger than zero.<br/>The charging of concurrent transfer connections exceeding the peak of the attached number (standard level is 1,000). Peak value will be measured once every hour. Expenses are allocated in proportion to 744 hours every month, and accumulated within the billing cycle of every month. At the end of the billing period, the amount added will be applied to the sum of the hourly peaks that are prorated (1,000 transfer connections every month).<br/>
                                        Examples<br/>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>You can establish connections with 10,000 devices through one AMQP Connection, receive commands from Service Bus themes and send remote-sensing events to Event Hubs. If all devices are connected 12 hours per day, you’re required to pay the following connection fees (excluding any other Service Bus fees): 10,000 connections * 12 hours * 31 days/744 = 5,000 transfer connections. After deducting the limit of 1,000 connections per month, you need to pay a fee of 4,000 transfer connections at a rate of RMB0.18 for every transfer connection, totaling RMB720.</li>
                                                <li>Timeout is not zero when 10,000 appliances receive messages from Service Bus queues via HTTP. If all appliances are connected 12 hours per day, you’re required to pay the following connection fees (excluding any other Service Bus fees): 10,000 HTTP receiving connections * 12 hours/day * 31 days/744 hours = 5,000 transfer connections.</li>
                                            </ol>

                                <a id="service_bus_transfer_queue">Does the transfer connection fee apply to queues and themes/subscriptions?</a>
                                <section>
                                    <p>Yes. Sending events by HTTP isn’t required to pay connection fees no matter how many sending systems/appliances you use. Receiving events by HTTP with a timeout greater than zero (sometimes called “Long-Poll”) will generate transfer connection fees. No matter whether the connection is used for sending or receiving, the AMQP connection will generate transfer connection fees. Please note, in the basic namespace, you can use at most 100 free transfer connections, which is the maximum of transfer connections permitted by every Azure subscription. In every Azure subscription, the first 1,000 transfer connections within any/all standard namespaces are free of charge (not included in basic fees). As these limits are enough to cover many service-to-service programs, there will generally be considerable transfer connection fees, only when you plan to use AMQP or HTTP Long-Poll on numerous clients, namely, to realize more efficient event flow or activate two-way communication between thousands of/millions of appliances or application instances.</p>

                                <section>
                                    <p>No. Every Azure subscription is only required to pay the monthly basic fees of a Standard Edition message transfer. This means that after you create a Standard tier Service Bus namespace, you will be able to create any number of Standard tier namespaces in the same Azure subscription without generating any additional basic fees.</p>

Every individual listener to be created is charged using the same rate. The services include 5 GB free data transmission every month. You can use this 5 GB free data transmission in all listener units. If the total data transmissions among all listener units exceed 5 GB, the extra data transmission is charged.</p>
