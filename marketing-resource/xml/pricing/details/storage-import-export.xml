					<p>With the Azure import/export service, you can use the HDD to transfer large amounts of data in and out of Azure. For the movement of large datasets, the importing/exporting is faster and more cost-effective than data transfer by the Internet. This service enables you to transfer data to Azure through the secure transfer from the HDD to the data center and the high-speed and secure internal network.</p>
