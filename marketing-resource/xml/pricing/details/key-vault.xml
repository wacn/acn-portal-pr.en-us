                    <li>Protect secrets such as keys and passwords.</li>
                    <li>Set up and deploy new vaults and keys in minutes without waiting for purchases, hardware or IT, and centrally manage keys, secrets, and policies.</li>
                    <li>Maintain control of encrypted data - Authorize yourself and third party and revoke the use of keys as needed.</li>
                    <li>Separation of key management responsibilities allows developers to easily manage keys for development/testing and production keys transferred seamlessly to security operations departments for management.</li>
                    <li>Rapid expansion can meet the encryption requirements of your cloud applications and satisfy high requirements.</li>
                    <li>Global redundancy can be achieved by provisioning vaults in Azure Global Data Center.</li>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The key can be input or generated. When you require the key vault service to use a key to decrypt or sign, perform operations in the key vault.</li>
                                        <li>You can also use the key for encryption. In this case, cryptographic operations are performed in the software. These calculations are performed in the Azure computing role.</li>
                                        <li>Secrets are data (25 KB or less) that your application can store and retrieve in plain text, such as passwords or PFX files. An access control layer is provided for secret encryption by keys with the support of the key vault.</li>

                                    <p>Operations of all keys and ciphertexts are charged uniformly at RMB 0.20/10,00 operations, including operations on keys for ciphertext and software protection. For example, during a billing cycle, you performed 2,000 operations by using keys and 500 operations using ciphertext. Then 2,500 chargeable operations will be generated in this billing cycle.</p>
