                                <section>
                                    <p>Whenever users access your applications, your service name is mapped to the IP address with the DNS query. By providing different response content for different DNS queries, the Traffic Manager can make the incoming traffic of your several hosted Azure services achieve load balance, no matter whether these services are operated in the same data center or different data centers in China.</p>
                                        <p>The Traffic Manager provides several load-balance methods, including transfer of performance, failover and round robin. Applying these methods can effectively manage traffic, ensure higher performance, availability and recovery capability.</p>

                                <section>
                                    <p>Applying Traffic Manager, you can utilize Azure service terminals for supervision and hosting, and Traffic Manager can also supply automatic failover features during service interruption, so as to improve availability of key applications.</p>
                                    <p>Therefore, Traffic Manager will continuously monitor operating conditions of every service terminal. When these “operating condition inspections” detect that a service is stopped, the Traffic Manager will route traffic to the other services again.</p>

                                <a id="Traffic_Manager_question4">How to reduce Traffic Manager fees?</a>
                                <section>
                                    <p>The PC of the end user will not directly contact the name server of the traffic manager while performing a DNS query. Instead, these queries will be sent by the "recursive" DNS server operated by the enterprise and the ISP. These servers will cache the DNS response results, so that other users' queries can be processed quickly. Meanwhile, these cached responses will not reach the Traffic Manager name server, thus no cost is incurred.</p>
                                    <p>The cache duration is determined by the “TTL” parameters responded to in the original DNS. This parameter can be configured in the Traffic Manager with a default value of 300s and minimal value of 30s.</p>
                                    <p>The larger TTL can be applied to increase the quantity of the completed cache of the recursive DNS server, so as to decrease DNS query fees. However, increasing the cache will also affect the speed for the end user receiving status changes in the terminal (that is, in case of failure of a terminal, the failover time of your end user will be extended). Thus we do not recommend using extremely large TTL values.</p>
                                    <p>Similarly, if the TTL is quite small, the failover speed will become faster, while due to the decreased cache, the query times for the name server of the Traffic Manager will increase.</p>
                                    <p>By configuring the TTL value by yourself, the traffic manager allows you to set the optimal TTL value based on the business needs of the application.</p>
