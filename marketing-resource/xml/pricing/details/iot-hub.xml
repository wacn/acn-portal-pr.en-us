                <p>Connect, monitor, and manage millions of IoT assets running on various operating systems and agreements to rapidly start your Internet of Things projects through Azure IoT Hub. If required, control access to specific devices to maintain system integrity. The reliable two-way communication (even intermittent connections) can be established with the help of these assets so as to analyze the input remote-sensing data and send commands and notifications according to requirements. Improve the security of IoT solutions by using the identity verification of each device and through suitable credentials and equipment communications.</p>

For example, if the device sends a 16 KB message via S1 or S2 edition, the message will be billed as 4 messages. Messages sent by connected devices via the free version are measured by 0.5 KB. For example, if a device sends a 16 KB message via the free Edition of the IoT Hub, the message will be billed as 32 messages.</p>
                                    <p>As for the paid SKU (namely S1 Edition and S2 Edition), the maximum size of messages that can be sent from the cloud to the device is 64 KB. Such messages are measured by 4 KB. For example, an 8 KB message sent via the S1 or S2 Edition will be billed as 2 messages. Messages sent via the free version are measured by 0.5 KB. For example, a 8 KB message sent via the free edition of the IoT Hub will be billed as 16 messages.</p>
