Within the 30-day count period, the number of job executions will be actually limited as follows: 21.6 million executions for every standard unit and 21.6 billion executions for every advanced unit. The word “limitless” in the tables above means that the total number of executions for every unit is limitless under the maximum execution frequency.</p>
