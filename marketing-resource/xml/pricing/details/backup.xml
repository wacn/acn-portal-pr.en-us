                    <p>Backup service is charged by the size of every protected instance, at an increment of 500 GB. In addition, Azure storage space is charged individually, allowing for reduction in long-lasting storage cost.

                                    <p>When maintaining data for a short period of time, the model for charging customers for the stored backup data for every GB is valid. With continued improvements in <a id="pri_bankup_keep2" href="http://azure.microsoft.com/zh-cn/updates/azure-backup-increases-features-and-supports-additional-dpm-workloads/">long-term retention</a> functions in Azure Backup, as well as continuous increases in pending backup data, the GB charging model brings high costs for customers that need to maintain data for a long period of time. The new business model enables customers to utilize the scale benefits brought by Azure storage space while continuously enjoying the enhanced functions of Azure Backup.</p>

If the virtual machine is also backed up in Azure Backup, it will be counted as another protected instance. As the size of virtual machine is smaller than 500 GB, ¥63.29 is charged.</p>
