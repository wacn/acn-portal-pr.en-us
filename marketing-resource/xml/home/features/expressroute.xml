                <h1>Experience a faster private connection to Azure</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Private connections to Azure</li>
                    <li>Increased reliability and speed</li>
                    <li>Lower latency</li>
                    <li>Higher security</li>
                    <li>Significant cost benefits possible</li>

                </ul>
                <h2>Make your connections fast, reliable, and secure</h2>
                <p>With Azure ExpressRoute, you can create private connections between an Azure Datacenter and infrastructure on your premises or in a colocation environment. ExpressRoute connections donâ€™t go over the public Internet, and offer more reliability, faster speeds, lower latencies, and higher security than typical Internet connections. In some cases, using ExpressRoute connections to transfer data between on-premises systems and Azure can give you significant cost benefits. You can use ExpressRoute to establish connections to Azure at an ExpressRoute location (ExpressRoute connects to service provider facilities).</p>

                <h2>Storage, backup, and recovery</h2>
                <p>ExpressRoute provides you with a fast and reliable connection to Azure, which is suitable for the following scenarios: periodic data migration, replication for business continuity, disaster recovery, and other high availability strategies. It can also be a cost-effective option for transferring large amounts of data (such as datasets for high-performance computing applications), or moving large virtual machines between your development/test environment in Azure and your on-premises production environment.</p>

                <h2>Expand your data center</h2>
                <p>ExpressRoute allows you to securely add compute and storage capacity to your existing data center. With high throughput and low latency, Azure feels like a natural extension of your data center, so you enjoy the scalability and economy of the public cloud without having to compromise on network performance.</p>

                <h2>Build hybrid applications</h2>
                <p>You can use the predictable, reliable, and high-throughput connections offered by ExpressRoute to build applications that span on-premises infrastructure and Azure without compromising security or performance. For example, run a corporate intranet application in Azure that authenticates your users with an on-premises Active Directory service, and serve all your corporate customers without traffic ever routing through the public Internet.</p>
