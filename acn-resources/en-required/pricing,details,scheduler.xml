Within the 30-day calculation period, the number of job executions will be actually limited as follows: 21.6 million executions for every standard unit and 21.6 billion executions for every Premium unit. The word “limitless” in the tables above means that the total number of executions for every unit is limitless within the maximum execution frequency.</p>

                                    <p>Yes, they are independent from each other, although they can both offer scheduling features.
