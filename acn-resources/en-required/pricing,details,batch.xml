                <p>Azure Batch provides operation scheduling and cluster management, allowing massive parallel running of apps or algorithms.</p>
                <p>There are no charges for Batch per se; we only charge for the basic computing and other resources used to run the batch services, including any applicable software licensing costs. You can use cloud services, Linux VMs or Windows VMs for the computing for batch processing. You can see details of how the relevant charges are calculated in the content below. The following section also provides information on software licensing costs for batch processing graphics and presentation. Batch allows you to use low-priority VMs. If you are using Azure Batch services in user subscription pool app mode, you can use reserved VM instances.</p>
                <h3>Low-priority VMs within Batch</h3>
                <p>Low-priority VMs are much cheaper than ordinary VMs and can significantly reduce the costs of running certain workloads, or enable you to complete more work at the same cost. However, as the characteristics of low-priority VMs are quite different, they are only suitable for certain types of app or workload. As low-priority VMs are allocated from excess capacity, availability may differ significantly from ordinary VMs, to the extent that it may sometimes be impossible to allocate VMs, or the allocated VMs may sometimes be occupied by higher-priority allocations. For this reason, availability SLAs for ordinary VMs do not apply to low-priority VMs.</p>
                <p>If your app can tolerate interruptions, using low-priority VMs may significantly reduce computing costs. Suitable workloads include batch processing and HPC services, and in such situations the work will be split into a large number of asynchronous tasks. If the VM is occupied, the tasks will be interrupted and rerun; if capacity falls, the amount of time taken to complete the operation will also increase correspondingly. Initially, low-priority VMs can only be used via Azure Batch processing; the latter provides operation scheduling and resource management for batch processing workloads. Azure Batch pools can contain both ordinary and low-priority VMs. If the low-priority VMs are occupied, any interrupted tasks will be put back in the queue, and the pool will attempt to automatically replace the lost capacity.</p>
