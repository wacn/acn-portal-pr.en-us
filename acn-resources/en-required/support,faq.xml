                                                    Answer: We recommend that you use the <a href="//docs.azure.cn/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-linux-manage-availability">Availability Set</a> in the architecture to ensure business continuity. In the Availability Set, this maintenance only updates one instance of one Update Domain (UD) at a time for Cloud Services and Virtual Machines. At the same time, we also encourage customers to cooperate with Microsoft contacts (sales field staff, technical support customer managers, etc.) for the Availability Set. For more information, please visit the <a href="//docs.azure.cn/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-linux-manage-availability">Virtual Machine Management Availability</a> web page.

                                                <p>When accessing a virtual machine via a VIP address, network communication needs to be through Azure Load Balancer. Azure Load Balancer currently does not open the ICMP protocol. Ping belongs to the ICMP protocol group and cannot access the Load Balancer. When customers need to verify the connectivity of virtual machines via VIP, they can operate with tools related to the TCP Protocol, referring to <a href="//docs.azure.cn/zh-cn/articles/azure-operations-guide/virtual-network/aog-virtual-network-tcp-psping-paping-connectivity">Using the PsPing &amp; PaPing for TCP port connectivity testing</a>.</p>

                                                    <li>The load balance can be carried for the Internet traffic transferred to the virtual machine. This configuration is called <a href="//docs.azure.cn/zh-cn/load-balancer/load-balancer-internet-overview">Internet-facing load balancing</a>.</li>

                                                <p>Azure Backup provides two types of copies: Locally Redundant Storage (LRS) and Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS). Locally Redundant Storage copies the data in the matching data center of the same region three times (creating three data copies). Geo-Redundant Storage copies the data to the secondary region several kilometers from the primary location of the source data. In order to prevent temporary storage unavailability arising from a disaster in one region, we recommend that customers copy data by way of reading and accessing Read-access Redundant Storage (RA-GRS). This way, in case of unavailability of the storage account of the primary region, the data can be accessed from the secondary region.</p>

                                                <p>Azure Virtual Machine disks contain a temporary disk, the D: disk (Windows) or /dev/sdb1 (Linux). They only provide temporary storage, so there is a risk of data loss, and the data cannot be completely recovered under some conditions. It is recommended that the disk is not used to store data long term. The user must bear the risk of data loss resulting from this. Loss of temporary disk data usually occurs when virtual machines are migrated to different host machines. The reasons for virtual machine migration include: adjustment of virtual machine size, updating the host machine, or host machine hardware failure. The time of virtual machine migrating cannot be predicted, and it may occur when the user is not conducting any operations. Therefore, we recommend that the disk is not used to store data long term. For more information on virtual machine disks and the high availability of virtual machines, refer to the following links:</p>

This service is built in with high availability, backup and recovery, geographical distribution, and disaster recovery.<br><br>In addition to the difference between the vertical/horizontal expansions, there are major differences in operating modes. The Azure SQL Database service covers management of the hardware and operating system, therefore, you can focus on building the solutions instead of purchasing, managing, patching, and licensing the hardware, virtual machines, operating systems and application platform software. While, for the dedicated database server (whether it is installed as traditional server in on-premises deployment, hosted in the virtual machine, or hosted by the third-party service provider), the developers and IT professionals are still being responsible for installing, setting up, updating, and patching the operating system and database software. Furthermore, users of the database server must design their own solutions for high availability, vertical expansion and disaster recovery, resulting in increased overall management costs.<br><br>Azure SQL Database is targeted at designing and optimizing applications with high scalability and high availability at a lower cost than a traditional vertical-scalability structure. As a result, Azure SQL Database is able to provide highly-available vertical-scaling solutions for commercial hardware and provide database functions in the form of services.</td>

The limited consulting services generally include answers to FAQs and sharing examples of best practices.</p>

                                            <section>
                                                <p>Yes. An enterprise administrator needs to log on to the EA portal website and add the account administrator for the original trial account as an account owner, and then log on to the EA portal with the new account to activate it. However, this process is irreversible, i.e., once you upgrade to an OSPA account, you cannot downgrade it again.</p>
